# Eltayeb Mohammed
**Senior Mechanical Engineer · Fintech Founder**

I build reliable systems—both in critical infrastructure and in modern fintech products. My work combines engineering discipline with product execution: clear scope, measurable outcomes, and solutions designed to scale responsibly.

## What I’m working on
- **SpinFund** — cooperative savings and ethical finance platform (MVP execution)
- **Web apps** deployed end-to-end: architecture, implementation, and release
- Applying engineering rigor to software: reliability, risk reduction, and clean interfaces

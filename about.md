## Background

I'm a **Senior Mechanical Engineer** with 18+ years of experience delivering critical infrastructure projects across the U.S., including transit systems in Chicago. My work has always required precision, safety-first thinking, and coordinating complex systems across multiple stakeholders.

I apply the same discipline to software: requirements-driven design, lifecycle awareness, and risk-based decision making.

## What I Build

I focus on **fintech and web applications**—products where trust, compliance, and reliability are non-negotiable.

**Current work includes:**
- Cooperative savings and ethical finance platforms
- Real-time communication tools
- AI-assisted productivity applications
- Modern web deployments with practical, production-ready architecture

## How I Work

<div class="values-list">

- **Systems thinking** — I look at the whole picture: requirements, constraints, dependencies, and downstream effects.
- **Risk-based design** — Identify what can go wrong early. Build controls and fallbacks into the architecture.
- **Clarity over cleverness** — Simple, maintainable solutions. Clear documentation. Code that other engineers can read and extend.
- **Ship and iterate** — Working software in production is the measure. Ship early, learn, improve.
